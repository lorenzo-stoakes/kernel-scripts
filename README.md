# Kernel Development Scripts

These are my kernel development scripts. Some are specific to my setup, others
are more generic. I'm working on making them more generic over time.

Generally I assume the distro I'm using (Arch Linux.) Additionally you will need
to install appropriate packages, again at some point I will try to document the
required packages.

The scripts have been expanded to include some rudimentary support for the
aarch64 architecture. To use this functionality, run `kerndev-create aarch64`
(or `kerndev-create-aarch64`) and `kerndev-run aarch64`.

## Acknowledgements

The qemu networking code is based on [Jakub Klinkovsk√Ω][lahwaacz]'s
[scripts][lahwaacz-scripts], [qemu-launcher.sh][qemu-launcher.sh] is a good
starting point for this. His code in turn uses [xyne][xyne]'s work.

The following scripts use this 3rd-party code:-

* `kerndev-qemu-tap-helper.sh`
* `kerndev-nat-launch.sh`
* `kerndev-nat-launch-subnet.sh`

## Scripts

__NOTE:__ These scripts are interdependent and assume that the they are all on
the `$PATH`.

__NOTE:__ By convention, files that end in `.sh` are not designed to be
user-runnable, but are instead ran from other scripts.

### Maintaining

* `kerndev-update` - Updates a list of linux trees in specific directories and
  on specific branches. This is configured to my personal setup, so you _will_
  need to edit this script to fit your set up. The list of directories and
  branches are clearly separated from the actual code that updates so this is a
  quick task.

### Generating

* `kerndev-create` - Creates a [qemu][qemu] kernel development environment. The
  image is an Arch Linux system.
* `kerndev-build` - Configures and builds the kernel, optionally placing header
  and module files into the dev env image. It accepts a single optional argument
  which, if provided, specifies a cross-compile target architecture.
* `kerndev-config` - Sets kernel configuration options for the development
  environment.
* `kerndev-rebuild` - Same as `kerndev-build` but runs `make mrproper` first.
* `kerndev-install` - Installs header and module files into the dev env
  image. This is invoked by `kerndev-build` unless explicitly disabled.
* `kerndev-module-headers` - Generates a stripped version of the kernel source
  for building external modules.

### Running

* `kerndev-run` - Runs the kernel development environment with virtio
  networking.
* `kerndev-debug` - Connects `gdb` to a running dev env. Debugging config
  options are enabled by `kerndev-build` by default. When you run
  `kerndev-debug` it runs `gdb` which automatically connects to the qemu
  instance.

__IMPORTANT:__ `gdb` has a big issue with the CPU changing architecture on
  startup, so you ought to run `kerndev-run` _before_ `kerndev-debug`. If you
  encounter `Remote 'g' packet reply is too long` errors you have triggered this
  issue and specifying arch afterwards doesn't seem to fix anything. If you need
  to debug early boot code, you'll need to investigate how to work around this
  issue :(

### Code

* `kerndev-check` - Runs `checkpatch.pl` against the specified files, ignoring
  line length.
* `kerndev-check-all` - Runs `checkpatch.pl` against the specified files.
